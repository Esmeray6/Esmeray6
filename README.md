Hi.

I'm Sky, a developer who creates random things in her free time. I'm mostly proficient in Python and Rust, currently getting into game development through a new project of mine called `Introspection`.
I also usually host events and often perform QA on Arma 3 missions at the amazing [Antistasi Event Team](https://discord.gg/antistasi).

I hope to create a deep-story game one day that I can look back to and be proud of.
