## Hello there

I am Assanali Mukhanov. I'm 20 years old, born and living in Kazakhstan. I go by the nicknames `Esmeray` and `Skydust` on most social media platforms, and you will mostly see me in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/YYtpYBr). I also occasionally browse stuff.

## Hobbies
My list of hobbies includes anything related to the military and firearms, programming, psychology, and law enforcement.

### Programming
I used to work a lot on Discord bots during 2018 and 2019. Since 2020 I have been busy with college and instead moved on to work on [dblpy/topggpy](https://github.com/top-gg/python-sdk). As of 2021, I've started to work on personal projects in Rust instead.

### Military/Law Enforcement
I get fascinated by the MilSim genre of video games and pretty much anything related to military equipment, stories, tactics, etc. This also includes anything related to law enforcement agencies.

### Psychology
Mostly learning random stuff regarding neurological disorders and trauma recovery.
